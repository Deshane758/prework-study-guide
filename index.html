        <ul>
          <li>Some HTML elements provide important information about a website to the browser, search engine and other developers</li>
          <li> Elements such as <meta> and <title> elements are nested in the <head> element</head></title></li>
          <li>Elements nested in other elements are called <b>"child elements"</b>. The element that holds all the child elements is known as the <b>"parent element"</b></li>
          <li>The <body> element is an example of a semantic HTML element - The name of the element describes its contents and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li> <b>Semantic HTML elements ensure your webpage is accessible to the masses including those who use assistive technologies like screen readers.</b></li>
          <li>HTML content is contained between an opening and closing tag represented by '<>' & '</>'</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents  the visible content shown to the user</li>

          <li> Css is used to add graphics to the user interface and to make the content on the page more appealing.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li> Inline styles apply to a special HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
