# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

To visibly see my development on this bootcamp course. It was designed to practise and get a taste for what is to come in regards to this course. This study guide has reminders and notes on HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git which will come in handy during this course. I've had to do some troubleshooting during this process and had to do research to figure some stuff out. Through repetitive use of git I have picked up on how to create, stage, pull and push branches to my master branch and much more.

## Usage

My Prework Study Guide is an interactive webpage which randomly selects a topic to study. I have listed the 4 topics we've practised on in this self assement HTML, GIT, CSS and Javascript. I've added notes to every section which lists the uses, defeinitions and important information about the topics. We can also use tools like Chrome devtools to inspect the webpage and see the functions working in the backend.
